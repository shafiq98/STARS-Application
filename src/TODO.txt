Problems :
1. Need to insert a function to check conflicts in scheduling
> Possible solution : Inside StudentCourseMgr, add 2 private methods.
    First method retrieves the 3 days and 3 (start, end) time pair for any given index
    Second method iterates through all currently registered courses (registered under student) and compares results between
    new course and already registered course. Once a boolean flag Conflict is set to true, break out and raise an error.

Features that need to be added :
1. E-mail notification System
2. Option for students to choose between different notification modes (SMS, WhatsApp, email)
