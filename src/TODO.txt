TODO

Problems :
1. Once a student drops an index, another student gets registered for it. but he's allowed to register for that index as well, instead of being put on waitlist
refer to :
stud1 dropping 10009
stud3 gets registered to 10009 automatically
but stud1 can still apply for 10009 and get it immediately, despite having no vacancies

Features that need to be added :
1. E-mail notification System
2. Option for students to choose between different notification modes (SMS, WhatsApp, email)
